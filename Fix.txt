Part 1:

Adding AppLoading
In the next lecture, we'll add the AppLoading component.

We will do this by importing it like this:

import { AppLoading } from 'expo';
This might fail for you - depending on the version of Expo you're using to follow along.

If it does fail, try this alternative way of adding it:

expo install expo-app-loading
import AppLoading from 'expo-app-loading';
Also add the following prop to the <AppLoading /> component (in your JSX code):

onError={(err) => console.log(err)}
In the end, you should have:

<AppLoading
    startAsync={fetchFonts}
    onFinish={() => setFontLoaded(true)}
    onError={(err) => console.log(err)}
/>


Part 2:

MUST READ: Installing Different Navigators
DON'T SKIP THIS LECTURE - PLEASE READ TO BOTTOM!

---

If you're using React Navigation v4 or higher, everything works as shown in this module but there is one important difference: You need to install the different navigators which we'll use in this module (StackNavigator, DrawerNavigator, TabsNavigator) separately.

So when we use the StackNavigator (= next lecture), run

npm install --save react-navigation-stack
before you start using it (with v3 and lower, it was part of react-navigation itself).

Also add this import in the file where you are using createStackNavigator:

import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';
Same for TabsNavigator (used a little bit later in this module):

npm install --save react-navigation-tabs
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from 'react-navigation-tabs';
And also for DrawerNavigator (also used later in this module):

npm install --save react-navigation-drawer
import { createDrawerNavigator } from 'react-navigation-drawer';

Part 3:

Header Buttons: Using the Correct Version
In the next lecture, we'll add a package named "react-navigation-header-buttons".

In order to avoid errors, make sure you're using the correct version of that package => Version 6

You can install that via npm install --save react-navigation-header-buttons@6

(instead of just npm install --save react-navigation-header-buttons which I use in the next lecture)
